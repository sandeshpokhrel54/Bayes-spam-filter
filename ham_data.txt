" neon retreatho ho ho  we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year    neon leaders retreat time i know that this time of year is extremely hectic  and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays  but life does go on past the week of december  through january   and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester  the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january     but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week  we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend  january     now comes the part you need to think about i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester  but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids  etc  so  brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend  and then you can let me know which you prefer the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years  this year we could go to the heartland country inn  www   com  outside of brenham  it ' s a nice place  where we ' d have a   bedroom and a   bedroom house side by side  it ' s in the country  real relaxing  but also close to brenham and only about one hour and  minutes from here  we can golf  shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham  eat dinner together at the ranch  and spend time with each other  we ' d meet on saturday  and then return on sunday morning  just like what we ' ve done in the past the second option would be to stay here in houston  have dinner together at a nice restaurant  and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening  this might be easier  but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together  i ' ll let you decide email me back with what would be your preference  and of course if you ' re available on that weekend  the democratic process will prevail   majority vote will rule  let me hear from you as soon as possible  preferably by the end of the weekend  and if the vote doesn ' t go your way  no complaining allowed  like i tend to do  have a great weekend  great golf  great fishing  great shopping  or whatever makes you happy bobby   "

" california energy crisiscalifornia ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months  unfortunately  this debate has generated more heat than light  we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis  please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues what happened in californiathe source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand  california ' s economy grew  percent since   this increased the demand for electricity by  percent  at the same time  regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state  so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added  the result  predictably  is a shortage  this summer  peak capacity will be about  percent shy of peak demand  leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance  there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis  first  the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market  the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile  the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term  medium term and short term  to reduce exposure to this volatility  in california  state regulation prevented this strategy  this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable  everything was fine while the power surplus persisted  but when shortages ensued  every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second  retail markets were not deregulated  regulated retail rates remained in effect  and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out  this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate  they are now nearly bankrupt in short  california ' s problems were caused by regulation  not deregulation  regulations prevented competitors from entering the market  prevented new generation from being built  and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan  enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives  which  if adopted  would have averted the current crisis enron ' s rolemany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem  power sellers  including enron  have been vilified by the politicians and the media  here are the facts    "
" big cowboy  additional productiontom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big cowboy production is coming from  apparently  hpl cut a deal to purchase this gas at  hpl meters  at rocher and big cowboy    so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe  all along  these volumes have been flowing into the gepl  big cowboy system and on to king ranch  tom and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place  as im wellhead  to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant  effective april   this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward please let me know if you have any further questions  comments  or information to add mary   "
